# simple-php-to-openAI-sdk

This is a simple PHP SDK to interact with OpenAI API or MistralAI API. 
It is a simple wrapper around the OpenAI API to make it easier to use in PHP.

I've added a simple PHP wrapper around the ClaudeAI API to generate some text from a single image.


- The file chat.php is a simple completion example with the OpenAI/MistralAI API.
- The file chatImage is a php wrapper around ClaudeAI API to generate some text from a single image.


You will need an API key to use this SDK. You can get one by signing up at https://openai.com or https://mistralai.com or https://claude.ai
